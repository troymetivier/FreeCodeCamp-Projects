  <p>With a passion for hunting the wild, pure backcountry and a love of the written word, Cameron’s greatest love is bowhunting the remote wildernesses of the West and Alaska.
  </p>
  <p>
For a glimpse into Cameron’s passion for bowhunting, look no further than his training regimen for his backcountry bowhunts. To get ready for bow season, in addition to shooting his bow every single day of the year, he trains in the weight room 7-days a week and runs 100-mile ultra marathons in the mountains during the off-season in an effort to toughen up for the mental and physical test that he’ll face in the backcountry. His goal, which he knows is a target he’ll never hit, is to become the “Ultimate Predator”.

Setting this type of standard, raising the bar to this level, pushing his body to failure and beyond, inspires many and inspiration is basically what best defines Cameron Hanes. Cameron has motivated thousands of hunters through his writings, television appearances and social media postings. “Hunters can be a tough crowd; they are savvy and can tell if what you write, or represent, is real or if you’re trying to sell them a bill of goods,” says Cameron. He continues, “You can’t pull the wool over their eyes. I practice what I preach and the public knows I am genuine because I grew up, and earned my hunting stripes, doing a lot of my hunts just like they do, on my own and on public land. It is because of this common thread that they seem to trust my advice.”

Bowhunting the toughest animals in the roughest country out there is as difficult as it gets, which is why Cameron’s life is devoted year-round to preparation. He trains intensively for that one, split-second chance to land an arrow on the mark. More often than not, one chance is all he gets when bowhunting in front of the camera. “The ‘one and done’ pressure is undeniable, but it is all a challenge I have come to crave and love’, says Cameron. “We have captured some amazing bowhunting footage in the face of very steep odds over the years.”

The motivation Cameron Hanes has is magnetic to hunters, and non-hunters alike, who read about and watch his undertakings. He has also been featured at widespread hunter’s gatherings including being the keynote speaker at many annual bowhunter banquets, hosted TV shows, been featured in TV commercials, self-published two books, produced DVDs and has released a line of popular hunting/fitness clothing. Devoting himself to learning and honing hunting techniques and ramping up his physical prowess has made for an exhilarating career for Cameron. Outdoorsmen have come to respect his knowledge and look forward to his stories and fitness advocates appreciate his drive to be the very best he can be and push others to do the same. Cameron has based his life and career around the things he loves writing, self-improvement, photography/filming, his family and bowhunting the backcountry. </p>
